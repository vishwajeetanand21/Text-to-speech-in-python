# Text to speech (using Python)
Text to speech is a process to convert any text into voice. Text to speech project takes words on digital devices and convert them into audio. Here I have used Google-text-to-speech library popularly known as gTTS library to convert text file to .mp3 file. The gTTS library supports several languages including English, Hindi, Tamil, French, German and many more. And before getting started in this project you have to install couple of python libraries like gTTS and playsound. 
In order to download the libraries, open your terminal and write (pip install gtts) and (pip install playsound).
In this project I have written the description of each line of code, this will make you clear with the coding section!
I have attached the file (icon of my window) with the exact code in this project.
Now you are all set to run the program.
Hope you like this project!
Thank you.
