# Text to speech (using Python)
Text to speech is a process to convert any text into voice. Text to speech project takes words on digital devices and convert them into audio. Here I have used Google-text-to-speech library popularly known as gTTS library to convert text file to .mp3 file.
In this project I have written the description of each line of code, this will make you clear with the coding section!
Hope you like this project!
Thank you.
